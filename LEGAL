I'm well aware that there are issues with copyrighting reverse-engineered code, and if it were entirely my work,
I wouldn't have liscensed it. Since this project was based off of code that wasn't mine that already had the 
liscense, I elected to keep the liscense intact, and obey its terms, as the author of the original code deserves
the credit( and the copyright, if that is actually legally sound ).

Sorry.
